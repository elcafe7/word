# Contributing to Word

Thanks for helping. This covers the Word web app and its offline HTML builds.

## Questions, bugs and ideas

Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/elcafe7/word/issues):

- **Bug:** [open an issue](https://github.com/elcafe7/word/issues/new) and say what you did, what you
  expected, and what happened instead. Include your browser or OS and the
  version or release you're using.
- **Idea or enhancement:** open an issue describing what you'd like and why.
- **Question:** open an issue and add the `question` label. There's no
  separate forum.

Please search the [existing issues](https://github.com/elcafe7/word/issues?q=is%3Aissue) first.

**Security problems:** don't open a public issue. Follow
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) to report it privately.

## Making a change

1. For anything bigger than a small fix, open an issue first so we can agree
   on the approach.
2. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
3. Make your change, with tests for any new behavior.
4. Run the checks below.
5. Open a [pull request](https://github.com/elcafe7/word/pulls) against `main` and describe what changed
   and why. Link the issue it fixes. Draft pull requests are welcome.

`main` is protected. Every change, including the maintainer's own, goes in
through a pull request that passes the required checks. The maintainer
reviews each pull request and may ask for changes before merging.

## Setting up

Needs Node 22 and Python 3.

```sh
npm ci
npm run data      # builds public/data/ from data/bible_versions/
```

## Checks to run before opening a pull request

```sh
npm test          # unit tests (Vitest)
npm run build     # production build
npx playwright install && npm run e2e      # browser tests, if you changed the UI
```

## Continuous integration

Every pull request runs **CodeQL** (GitHub code scanning), and it must pass
before merging. The unit tests run locally (above) and again in the release
workflow ([`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml)),
which won't publish a release unless they pass.

## Requirements for contributions

- Plain JavaScript ES modules. Follow the style of the code around your change.
- The app has no runtime dependencies. Please keep it that way, or open an
  issue to discuss it first.
- Don't change the Bible databases in `data/bible_versions/` or any text
  readers see without opening an issue first. They're shared with
  [Verse](https://github.com/elcafe7/verse).
- Don't commit credentials or other secrets.
- Add or update tests for new features and bug fixes where practical.
- Update the README or docs if you change how something is used.
- Keep each pull request to one topic.

## Sign-off and license

No Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) sign-off and no contributor license
agreement are needed. By opening a pull request you agree that your
contribution is licensed under the project's [MIT License](LICENSE).
